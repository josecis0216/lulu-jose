              Clari and Litos met freshman year of high school back in August
              2009. Clarissa's first thought of Litos was, "wow that is some
              really spiky hair!!!" and Litos' thought was "oh, she cute (only
              to never talk to her)" fast forward to June 2010 when clari heard
              the news about Litos moving schools. Basically, Clarissa professed
              her love for litos in his yearbook, as she took up A WHOLE PAGE +
              the binding.<br />
              PLUS THE BINDING!!!<br />
              Only for Litos to not get the hint and basically never speak to
              Clarissa again.
            </p><br>
            <p>
              We later learned that they tried talking on Facebook and other
              social media platforms here and there over the years. Only to see
              that Litos once again didn't take the hint. Their last message on
              Facebook was back in 2011, where clari left Litos on read because
              he failed to keep the conversation alive. ("ha ha yeah" was the
              last message sent by Litos... i know i know. Poor guy didn't know
              how to talk to this cute girl.)
            </p><br>
            <p>
              Years later, now 2018 Litos sent clari a DM about hanging out! He
              thought, oh we are both in California, let's meet up. And
              Clarissa's like what. and then it never happened. Because who goes
              on a date while on vacation?????
            </p><br>
            <p>
              Fast forward to the now. Clari was having a housewarming party
              Labor Day weekend. And with the help of some liquid courage, and a
              little pep talk from one of Clari's besties, Clari sent Litos the
              epic dm! She replied to his story of a photo of Jordanelle
              Reservoir, "Where is this?" Litos played his cool and probably
              took 2 hours to finally reply!!!! Litos was trying to play it cool
              because this cute girl from high school just sent him a chat! From
              that reply on, the two were constantly smiling at their phones
              super excited about what could be.
            </p><br>
            <p>
              I will give some credit to Litos, because yes, he finally asked
              Clari out and took her on a scenic drive to see the beautiful fall
              leaves! Many dates went by and on November 3rd, 2018, litos asked
              Clari to be his partner. And clari said "FINALLY" because to her
              it felt like it was taking him forever to ask her to officially be
              his girlfriend.
            </p><br>
            <p>
              From then on Clarissa and Carlos went on to make memories that
              they will now cherish forever, and they couldn't be happier to
              have everyone in their lives to share them with.
